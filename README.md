### About me

Hello! I am a senior undergraduate at [ENSIAS](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_nationale_sup%C3%A9rieure_d%27informatique_et_d%27analyse_des_syst%C3%A8mes) Majoring in Artificial Intelligence. Prior to ENSIAS, I completed two years of preparatory program [(CPGE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles) in Lycée Al Khansaa Majoring in Mathematics, Physics and Engineering Sciences. During my undergraduate studies, I interned at [Oracle Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Labs).

<!-- Hello! I am a 5th year doctoral candidate at the MIT Operations Research Center, advised by Prof. Bart Van Parys. Prior to joining MIT, I graduated from Ecole Polytechnique in 2019 Majoring in Applied Mathematics and completed two years of preparatory program (CPGE) in Lycée Louis-le-Grand. During my PhD, I interned at Google Research and subsequently continued as part-time there.

My research interest lies in Data-driven Decision-making, with a focus on reliability attributes such as robustness and interpretability. I strive to understand how to use most efficiently observed data to make decisions. The goal is to derive from these insights novel algorithms that tackle challenges in data-driven decision-making. My recent work focuses on designing novel robust approaches to Stochastic Optimization problems using Distributionally Robust Optimization. We have applied these approaches to various problems such as portfolio optimization and training neural networks, resulting in state-of-art performance. Earlier in my PhD, I have worked in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to introduce a novel more efficient and interepretable RL framework. We have then applied this framework to COVID-19 predictions and vaccine allocation. -->

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
